# Feature-engineering on a dependency parser

The goal of this project was to predict house prices as accurately as possible. To do this, we exploited two approaches: one by regression on the exact price and another by classification on predefined price intervals. We mainly used neural networks during this project.
This project is a project in the field of Natural Language Processing. The aim was to develop a transition-based dependency parser, which predicts the syntactic structure of a sentence (the part-of-speech of each word as well as their relationship). Then, we tried to improve its accuracy by adding new features to our model, based on the work of Yue Zhang and Joakim Nivre "Transition-based Dependency Parsing with Rich Non-local Features". We tested our algorithm on an English and a Chinese dataset provided by Universal Dependencies (https://universaldependencies.org).
